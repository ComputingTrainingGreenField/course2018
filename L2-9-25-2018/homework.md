# Homework (L2-09-25-2018)
1.  Setup development environment

* Setup github account
  * https://github.com/
  * choose a good user name that easy for you and your teammate to remember
  * send your user name to me so I can add you to the group
* Setup git tools (if you are using windows)
  * Download and install git: https://git-scm.com/downloads
  * Download and install git GUI sourcetree: https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/
* Setup Visual Studio Code (IDE)
  * https://code.visualstudio.com/
  * Choose to integrate with explorer
  * Install NativeScript extension: https://www.nativescript.org/nativescript-for-visual-studio-code
* Setup NativeScript command-line interface (CLI)
  * Follow the instructions: https://docs.nativescript.org/start/quick-setup
  * Learn the basic of NativeScript CLI: https://docs.nativescript.org/start/cli-basics
  * Create a test app and run it with CLI (For windows environment, the run will trigger an Android emulator)
2. Read [project list](https://github.com/ComputingTrainingGreenField/course2018/blob/master/L2-9-25-2018/projects.md) and descriptions, do one of the following:

   (1) Choose a project that you like  
   (2) Prepare a project idea and detail description for your own  
   (3) If no project to choose, you will do the library navigation project as a group project

   Our goal is to deliver your own app by the end of this course. All projects share similar structure. We will teach the common technics to build the app. You will apply them to specific project. Once you choose a project, you will be responsible to refine the requirements, plan for the development tasks and I will help you to address the technical questions.

3. Continue for the basic programming tutuorial. It is import to get familar with the foundamental concepts.
