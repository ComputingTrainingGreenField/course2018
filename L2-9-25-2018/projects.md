# Project List

This document is to list a few project ideas with detail descriptions. The projects serve as a guideline for some useful apps, which may have social impact, potential to extend, intereting to use for yourself, and future business opportunities for you to grow yourself, just like the library navigation app we discussed at the beginning of the class. I encourage you to think about any new ideas along the similar line, which you can take ownership of delivering it with extra efforts.
